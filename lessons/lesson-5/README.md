# Assignment 5
In this assignment we will be experimenting with classes. The goal is to create a class that allows users to play a game of hangman. An example TicTacToe game can be found [here](../../examples/tictactoe.py).

For more information, see the comments in the [hangman game python file](./hangman.py).
