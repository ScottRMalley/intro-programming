# Assignment 3
Write all the following functions in a single python file.
1. Write a function called list_digits(n) that takes in a number and returns a list of all the digits. For example:
	list_digits(931) = [9, 3, 1]
2. Write a function called list_to_base_10(b, l) that takes a base b and a list of digits l (representing a number in that base), and gives the base 10 representation of that number. For example:
	list_to_base_10(2, [1, 0, 1, 1]) = 11 # this would represent the binary number 1011 which is equal to 11
	list_to_base_10(3, [1, 2, 0]) = 15 
3. Write a function called to_base_10(b,n) that combines the two previous functions to take a base b and a number n, and give the base 10 representation. For example:
	to_base_10(2, 1011) = 11
	to_base_10(3, 120) = 15
